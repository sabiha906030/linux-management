### Step 1: Create a Group
First, we created a group called "projekti" and made both Tupu and Lupu members of this group. Think of this like creating a team and adding both users to it.

### Step 2: Create the Shared Folder
We set up the shared folder with special settings that make it work like this:

It's like a shared workspace that only team members can enter
Anything created in this folder automatically becomes shared with the team
Nobody outside the team can peek inside

### Step 3: Double-Check Everything Works
We tested the setup to make sure:

Tupu could create new files 
Lupu could open and edit these files 
Both users could work on the same files 
Everything stayed shared automatically 

__Permission Settings (2770)__
2️ - Makes sure everything in the folder is automatically shared with the group
7️ - Gives the folder owner (root) full control
7️ - Gives the group (our team) full control
0️ - Gives everyone else no access at all

__Final Check__

When we look at the folder settings, we can confirm:

The system (root) owns the folder
Our team (projekti group) has full access
The automatic sharing feature is working
The folder is private - only team members can access it

__Why This Works So Well__

Everything stays organized because files are automatically shared
Both users can work together smoothly
The folder stays secure from other users
No need to manually set permissions for each new file

This setup creates a perfect collaborative space where Tupu and Lupu can work together while keeping their files secure!
